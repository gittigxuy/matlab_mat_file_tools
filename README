matlab_mat_file_tools
=====================

A python tool set to read data from matlab mat files using scipy.io and h5py (Also requires numpy). The goal of the project is to have a function that will replace sio.loadmat in scripts and work with both unicode and hdf5 mat files. License is GNU GPLv2.

Usage - include in a python script in the following way:

import mat_file_tools as mft
data = mft.load_data('/path/to/mat/file.mat')

Available functions:
load_data(data_file, vars_in = None)
This is the basic function that reads a mat file and returns a dict containing data
Inputs: data_file - a string with the path to a mat file
        vars_in - a list of strings with variable names to load in. If this is None, 
                  all variables are read in.
Outputs: data - a dict containing data. Each matlab variable is referenced by name (string)

get_variable_list(data_file)
This function finds the variable names stored in a mat file.
Inputs: data_file - a string with the path to a mat file
Outputs: var_list - a list of strings containing variable names.
